# RestTemplate Study #

This repo is dedicated to understand the use of the component RestTemplate in Spring environment.

### Concept ###

Component capable of communicating with APIs, simple and really basic use compared to another languages like Typescript and Python.

## Run The Application / Endpoints ##

As it is a basic understanding of the component, there's just 5 endpoints.

To wrap it up I dockerized this application, in case you wanna try it out.

Just type the command to run it.
```bash
sudo docker compose up --build
```

To run it again, just type in.
```bash
sudo docker compose up
```
